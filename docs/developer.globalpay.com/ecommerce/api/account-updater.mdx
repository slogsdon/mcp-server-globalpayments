#### Update file syntax

_Type_ indicates whether the element is Mandatory (M), Optional (O), or Conditional (C) – dependent on another field.

| Element/Field | Type | Format | Length | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |    
| Payer Reference | M   | string | 1-50 | The Payer Reference identifying the customer in Card Storage. |
| Payment Method | O   | string | 1-50 | The Payment Method reference identifying the card in Card Storage to be submitted for an update. If not present, the Payer must have a default card set up. |
| Amount | M   | integer | 1-9 | The predicted amount of the future transaction in the minor unit of the currency (e.g., €100.00 should be submitted as "10000"). If unknown, submit as 0. |
| Transaction Date | M   | string | 8   | The predicted date of the future transaction. If unknown, submit as today's date + 7 days (e.g., if today is 1st of March 2017 - 20170301, submit as 20170308 - 8th of March 2017). |

### Sample update response

After initial validation of an update request, a `JobID` is returned in the response. This can be used to track the request through the update lifecycle using the status endpoint. In the event of validation errors occurring, the response will contain additional information on why the request failed.

## Status

The Status request allows you to query the current status for a particular `JobID`. We provide a status for each `JobID` as it goes through the request lifecycle. 

#### Sample request

The status request must be sent to one of the below endpoints. These endpoints will accept an HTTP GET request. If the content of the initial update request passed validation, the status will be returned. If validation of the initial update request failed, the details of the validation error are returned.

<Infobox>
In the Sandbox environment, a status of _Validating_ will always be returned.

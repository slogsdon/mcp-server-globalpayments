## Generate hash
Follow the steps in this section to build the request security hash, concatenate the specified fields and hash them using the SHA-256 algorithm, concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret, hash it again, and add the resulted string to the request. 

<Infobox>
In addition to SHA-256, you can also generate your hash using SHA-1. The resulting hash should be placed in the `<sha256hash>` tag instead of the `<sha1hash>` tag. For more information, contact our support team. 
</Infobox>

  ### Build the request hash
1. Using the SHA-256 algorithm, hash a string made up of the request values
    The blueprint of the hash for this request is shown below: <br/><br/>
    <Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
    ```
    "request_timestamp.merchant_id.cardnumber"
    ```
    </Code> <br/>
    Based on the request above, our initial string will be: <br/><br/>
    <Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
    ```
    "2019-04-26T10:16:10.154248.MerchantId.4263970000005262"
    ```
    </Code> <br/>
2. Concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret
After step 1, you'll have a string like: <br/><br/>
    <Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
    ```
    f6d5f2950c49e85bee09119d50de7ca76243de9c4f4ca340175b563162868e2e
    ```
    </Code> <br/>
    You'll need to concatenate this with your Shared Secret. For example: <br/><br/>
    <Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
    ```
    "f6d5f2950c49e85bee09119d50de7ca76243de9c4f4ca340175b563162868e2e.Po8lRRT67a"
    ```
    </Code> <br/>
3. SHA-256 hash the concatenated string
    Our final string that we add to the request should be a hash using the SHA-256 algorithm of your concatenated string. For example: <br/><br/>
    <Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
    ```
    8f2436777317085a3442286315f69532592222fc4e325b69559559179ce6120c
    ```
    </Code>

## Check hash
Follow the steps in this section to build the response security hash, concatenate the specified fields and hash them using the SHA-256 algorithm, concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret, hash it again, and add the resulted string to the request. 

### Check the response hash

1. Create a SHA-256 hash string made up of response values
    The blueprint of the hash for the response is shown below: <br/><br/>

    <Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
    ```
    "timestamp.merchantid.orderid.result.message.pasref.authcode"
    ```
    </Code> <br/><br/>
    So, based on the above example, the initial string to check the hash of the response will be: <br/><br/>
    <Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
    ```
    "20200204155942.Merchant ID.N6qsk4kYRZihmPrTXWYS6g.00.[ test system ] Authorised.14631546336115597.12345"
    ```
    </Code> <br/>
2. Concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret
    After step 1, you'll have a string like: <br/><br/>
    <Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
    ```
    f4c954b5196e73883edcf1d74e5722ced0914dea852c52a07fbe1b4b04c8ca6b
    ```
    </Code> <br/>
    You'll need to concatenate this with your Shared Secret: <br/><br/>
    <Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
    ```
    "f4c954b5196e73883edcf1d74e5722ced0914dea852c52a07fbe1b4b04c8ca6b.Po8lRRT67a"
    ```
    </Code> <br/>
3. SHA-256 hash the concatenated string and compare
    Our final string that we add to the request should be a hash using the SHA-256 algorithm of your concatenated string. For example: <br/><br/>
    <Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
    ```
    f18178e6bf4d1bf17269fbd8a244fbd43be60c1d9b868bf00e06307b6d76d9be
    ```
    </Code> <br/><br/>
    We create the hash in the same way on our side and send it back. To confirm that a response hasn't been tampered with, compare what you've generated with what was returned in the `sha256hash` element.

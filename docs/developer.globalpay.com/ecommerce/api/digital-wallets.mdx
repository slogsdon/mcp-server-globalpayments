In this API reference, we present an overview of each request type, examples of request and response values, as well as how to handle them. For more information on Digital Wallets, see our [Overview](/ecommerce/expand-your-integration/digital-wallets).

## Apple Pay
Apple Pay provides a highly secure, instant payment experience. It allows users to securely store their card details on a Secure Element built into their Apple product and to use those card details to make payments. It can be used in-app to provide payment for real-world goods and services.

It's possible to test Apple Pay in our Sandbox environment. The amount specified in the request will map the tokenized data in the transaction to one of our test cards. For example, an amount of 10.00 will map to the successful Visa test card. For more information, see the [Apple Pay](/resources/test-card-numbers#card-apple-pay) section of our Test Cards article.

<Infobox>
Apple Pay is not supported by all acquirers. For more information, contact our support team. <br/>
We support 2-exponent amounts (e.g., GBP £10.00). However, currencies with a different exponent such as exponent 0 (e.g., 10 JPY) or exponent 3 (e.g., 10.000 BHD) are currently not supported. <br/>
A shortened version of the Apple Pay token was used in this section.

## Generate hash
Follow the steps in this section to build the request security hash, concatenate the specified fields and hash them using the SHA-1 algorithm, concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret, hash it again, and add the resulted string to the request.

<Infobox>
In addition to SHA-1, you can also generate your hash using SHA-256. The resulting hash should be placed in the `<sha256hash>` tag instead of the `<sha1hash>` tag. For more information, contact our support team.
</Infobox>

### Build the request hash
Use the tabs below to follow the steps for a certain request type: Apple Pay or Google Pay. 

<Tabs active="apple">  
<Tab id="auth" title="Apple Pay">

##### 1. Create a SHA-1 hash made up of request values
The blueprint of the hash for this request is:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"timestamp.merchantid.orderid.amount.currency.token"
```
</Code>

Since the amount and currency are contained in the token, based on the XML example above our initial string will be:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"20200205093140.Merchant ID.N6qsk4kYRZihmPrTXWYS6g...{'version':'EC_v1','data':'Ft+dvMNzlcy6WNB+zerKtkh/RWW4RWW4yXIRgmM3WC/FYEC6Z+OJEzir2sDyzDkjIUJ0TFCQd/QAAAAAAAA==','header':{'ephemeralPublicKey':'MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEWdNhNAHy9kO2Kol33kIh7k6wh6E/lxriM46MR1FUrn7SHugprkaeFmWKZPgGpWgZ+telY/G1+YSoaCbR5YSoaCbR57bdGA==','transactionId':'fd88874954acdb299c285f95a3202ad1f330d3fd4ebc22a864398684198644c3','publicKeyHash':'h7WnNVz2gmpTSkHqETOWsskFPLSj31e3sPTS2cBxgrk='}}"
```
</Code>

##### 2. Concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret
After step 1, you'll have a string like: 28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882

You'll need to concatenate this with your Shared Secret, for example:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882.Po8lRRT67a"
```
</Code>

##### 3. SHA-1 hash the concatenated string

Our final string that we add to the request should be a hash, using the SHA-1 algorithm, of your concatenated string. For example: 947903969e7aaf996164c680a6669805fe405269

After step 1, you'll have a string like: 28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882

You'll need to concatenate this with your Shared Secret, for example:

</Tabs>

## Check hash
Follow the steps in this section to build the response security hash, concatenate the specified fields and hash them using the SHA-1 algorithm, concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret, hash it again, and add the resulted string to the request.

### Check the response hash
Use the tabs below to follow the steps for a certain request type: Apple Pay or Google Pay. 

<Tabs active="apple">

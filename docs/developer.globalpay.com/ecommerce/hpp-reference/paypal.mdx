In this Hosted Payment Page (HPP) reference, we present an overview of each request type, along with examples of request and response values. For more information on PayPal, see our [main article](/ecommerce/expand-your-integration/paypal).

## PayPal example

#### Sample request
You can pass transaction references and a transaction description to PayPal if required. To qualify for PayPal's Seller Protection, you must pass the customer’s shipping address in the request.

## Generate hash
Follow the steps in this section to build the request security hash, concatenate the specified fields and hash them using the SHA-1 algorithm, concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret, hash it again, and add the resulted string to the request.

<Infobox>
In addition to SHA-1, you can also generate your hash using SHA-256. The resulting hash should be placed in the `<sha256hash>` tag instead of the `<sha1hash>` tag. For more information, contact our support team. 
</Infobox>

### Build the request hash
Follow these steps to build the hash for the Initiate request type: PayPal Example

1. Using the SHA-1 algorithm, hash a string made up of the request values
The blueprint of the hash for this request is:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"timestamp.merchantid.orderid.amount.currency"
```
</Code>

Based on the example above, our initial string will be:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"20200324121120.MerchantID.N6qsk4kYRZihmPrTXWYS6g.1001.EUR"
```
</Code>

2. Concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret
After Step 01 you'll have a string like: 28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882

You'll need to concatenate this with your Shared Secret, for example:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882.Po8lRRT67a"
```
</Code>

3. SHA-1 hash the concatenated string
Our final string that we add to the request should be a hash, using the SHA-1 algorithm, of your concatenated string. For example: 947903969e7aaf996164c680a6669805fe405269

## Check hash
Follow the steps in this section to build the response security hash, concatenate the specified fields and hash them using the SHA-1 algorithm, concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret, hash it again, and add the resulted string to the request.

### Check the response hash

<Infobox>
The Timestamp returned in the response will be identical to the one sent in the request POST. This, combined with the Order ID and other transaction variables, can be used to definitively link the response received with the transaction request and order created in your application. You should also check the other transaction variables, for example the Amount, against what was stored in your application at the time the request POST was sent.
</Infobox>

1. Using the SHA-1 algorithm, hash a string made up of some of the response values
The blueprint of the hash for the response is:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"timestamp.merchantid.orderid.result.message.pasref.authcode"
```
</Code>

So, based on the above example, the initial string to check the hash of the response will be:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"20200205184615.Merchant ID.N6qsk4kYRZihmPrTXWYS6g.00.[ test system ] Authorised.14631546336115597.12345"
```
</Code>

2. Concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret
After Step 1 you'll have a string like: 28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882

You'll need to concatenate this with your Shared Secret:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882.Po8lRRT67a"
```
</Code>

3. SHA-1 hash the concatenated string and check the output against what was returned in the HPP response

Our final string that we add to the request should be a hash, using the SHA-1 algorithm, of your concatenated string. For example: 947903969e7aaf996164c680a6669805fe405269

We create the hash in the same way on our side and send it back. To confirm that a response hasn't been tampered with, compare what you've generated with what was returned in the `sha1hash` element.

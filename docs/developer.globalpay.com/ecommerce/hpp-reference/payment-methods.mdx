In this Hosted Payment Page (HPP) reference, we present changes to the HPP request and response where applicable to the payment method. For more information on Alternative Payment Methods (APMs), see our [main article](/ecommerce/expand-your-integration/payment-methods).

## Initiate
In this request, we set up integration fields for five APMs (in addition to our standard authorization fields). This will give you access to over 20 APMs. For others that require additional information, you can browse each payment method below.

Once the customer makes their choice, the HPP redirects their browser to the payment method so they can authenticate and authorize the transaction. Once that’s complete, they will be redirected back to your application along with the transaction response.

To present the most relevant payment methods to your customer, you can pre-select one or more in the request. To do this, include the optional `PM_METHODS` field.

#### Request syntax
_Type_ indicates whether the element is Mandatory (M), Optional (O), or Conditional (C) - dependent on another field.

Unless otherwise stated in the description, the allowed special characters in an alphanumeric string field are [/.-_‘,␣]

| Element/Field | Category | Format | Type | Length | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Timestamp | string | numeric | M   | 14  | Entered in the following format: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.  <br/>If the timestamp is more than a day (86400 seconds) away from the current time, the request will be rejected. Automatically set if using the SDK. |

| Status Update URL | string | URL | M   | 1-2083 | The endpoint which will receive payment status messages. This will include the result of the transaction or any updates to the transaction status. For certain asynchronous payment methods these notifications may come minutes, hours or days after the initial authorization. |
| PM Methods | string | alphanumeric | O   | 0-100 | Optional field which allows you to select payment method(s) to offer the customer, or route customer to a specific one.  <br/>"cards\|paypal\|sofort"  <br/>If you offer a specific range of payment methods you should also provide the additional required and optional fields for any of these payment methods.  <br/>Allowed characters: \[a-z\|\] |
| Sha1hash | string | alphanumeric | M   | 40  | The signature for this request is made up of transaction elements and your Shared Secret. Automatically set by the SDK.  <br/>Allowed characters: \[0-9a-fA-F\] |

## Redirect response

Once the customer completes their transaction with the payment method, they are redirected to the URL you provided in the `MERCHANT_RESPONSE_URL` field of the HPP request. The current status of the transaction will also be sent as an HTTP POST to that URL.

Your application might put the customer on hold for a few seconds while it checks to see if the Status URL was sent a final update. You can then redirect the customer to a final success or failure page.

## Status update

The URL specified in the `HPP_TX_STATUS_URL` field receives the final status. Depending on the payment method used, this can happen at the same time as the customer is redirected to your response URL, moments after — or, potentially, the final status update might come days later.

For payment methods in which you expect the final status update to come days later, your Status URL will need to accept the message sent by us, find the correct order in your application, and update the status accordingly. You may want to inform the customer at this point that their payment was finally accepted. You can also initiate the dispatch of items to the customer.

The timeout period indicates how long the customer has to complete the payment, and by extension, how long your application may need to wait to receive the final status. For timeout details, see the individual [Supported Payment Methods](/payment-methods-list).

## Test pay
To test your integration, we provide a simple simulator application that allows you to test the customer being redirected to the HPP and the payment method, along with your Response and Status URLs.

## Simulator page

![Test Pay Simulator Page](/gh-assets/ecommerce/apm_simulator-page.jpg)

The Simulator page provides a range of messages to send to the Return and Status URLs. The delay selection determines when the Status URL receives the final status update. You can test PMs in which  the final status is sent moments, hours, or even days after the transaction is completed by the customer. 

The final status might also be sent at the same time as the redirection and message to the Return URL (No Delay). The responses returned by the simulator will be the same format of those outlined in the other steps in this guide.

The response and delay selections are outlined below.

| Response Selection | Delay Selection |
| --- | --- |
| Succeeded | No delay |
| Pending | 30s after submit |
| Failed UserAbort | 1m after submit |
| Failed InputData | 5m after submit |
| Failed LocalDecline | 15m after submit |
| Failed RemoteDecline | 1h after submit |
| Failed Timeout |     |
| Failed LocalError |     |
| Failed RemoteError |     |
| Failed Unknown |     |

## Generate hash
Follow the steps in this section to build the request security hash, concatenate the specified fields and hash them using the SHA-1 algorithm, concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret, hash it again, and add the resulted string to the request.

<Infobox>
In addition to SHA-1, you can also generate your hash using SHA-256. The resulting hash should be placed in the `<sha256hash>` tag instead of the `<sha1hash>` tag. For more information, contact our support team.
</Infobox>

### Build the request hash
Follow these steps to build the hash for the Initiate request type.

1. Using the SHA-1 algorithm, hash a string made up of the request values
The blueprint of the hash for this request is:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"timestamp.merchantid.orderid.amount.currency"
```
</Code>

Based on the POST example above, our initial string will be:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"20200205093140.MerchantID.N6qsk4kYRZihmPrTXWYS6g.1001.EUR"
```
</Code>

2. Concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret
After Step 1, you'll have a string like: 28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882

You'll need to concatenate this with your Shared Secret, for example:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882.Po8lRRT67a"
```
</Code>

3. SHA-1 hash the concatenated string
Our final string that we add to the request should be a hash, using the SHA-1 algorithm, of your concatenated string. For example: 947903969e7aaf996164c680a6669805fe405269

## Check hash
Follow the steps in this section to build the response security hash, concatenate the specified fields and hash them using the SHA-1 algorithm, concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret, hash it again, and add the resulted string to the request.

### Check the Response hash
Use the tabs below to follow the steps for a certain request type: Redirect Response and Status Update

<Infobox>
The Timestamp returned in the response will be identical to the one sent in the request POST. This, combined with the Order ID and other transaction variables, can be used to definitively link the response received with the transaction request and order created in your application. You should also check the other transaction variables (for example, the Amount) against what was stored in your application at the time the request POST was sent.
</Infobox>

<Tabs active="redirect">  
<Tab id="redirect" title="Redirect Response">

1. Using the SHA-1 algorithm, hash a string made up of some of the response values
The blueprint of the hash for the response is:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"timestamp.merchantid.orderid.result.message.pasref.paymentmethod"
```
</Code>

So, based on the above example, the initial string to check the hash of the response will be:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"20200205093140.MerchantId.N6qsk4kYRZihmPrTXWYS6g.00.SUCCEEDED.14963290674458276.sofort"
```
</Code>

2. Concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret
After Step 1, you'll have a string like: 28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882

You'll need to concatenate this with your Shared Secret:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882.Po8lRRT67a"
```
</Code>

3. SHA-1 hash the concatenated string and check the output against what was returned in the HPP response

Our final string that we add to the request should be a hash, using the SHA-1 algorithm, of your concatenated string. For example: 947903969e7aaf996164c680a6669805fe405269

We create the hash in the same way on our side and send it back. To confirm that a response hasn't been tampered with, compare what you've generated with what was returned in the `sha1hash` element.

</Tab>
 
<Tab id="status" title="Status Update">

1. Using the SHA-1 algorithm, hash a string made up of some of the response values
The blueprint of the hash for the response is:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"timestamp.merchantid.orderid.result.message.pasref.paymentmethod"
```
</Code>

So, based on the above example, the initial string to check the hash of the response will be:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"20200205184615.MerchantId.N6qsk4kYRZihmPrTXWYS6g.00.SUCCEEDED.14963290674458276.sofort"
```
</Code>

2. Concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret
After Step 1, you'll have a string like: 28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882

You'll need to concatenate this with your Shared Secret:

<Code id="markup" title="" language="markup" active>
```
"28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882.Po8lRRT67a"
```
</Code>

3. SHA-1 hash the concatenated string and check the output against what was returned in the HPP response
Our final string that we add to the request should be a hash, using the SHA-1 algorithm, of your concatenated string. For example: 947903969e7aaf996164c680a6669805fe405269

We create the hash in the same way on our side and send it back. To confirm that a response hasn't been tampered with, compare what you've generated with what was returned in the `sha1hash` element.

| HPP\_MAX\_TERM\_  <br/>MONTHS\_MERCHANT\_FUNDED | O   | Used to retrieve installment plans with specific tenure. Applicable to merchant-funded plans only. Should accept numbers only; max length is 4 digits.  <br/>For example:  <br/>_max\_term\_months\_merchant\_funded = 12_  <br/>A value of 12 sent means that:  <br/>–Only plans with tenure ≤ 12 months are retrieved.  <br/>–Merchant-funded plans with tenure > 12 months are not returned.  <br/>Default: 1,000  <br/>++Note++: If not present, request will be sent with default value. |

In this Hosted Payment Page (HPP) reference, we present an overview of each request type, examples of request and response values, as well as how to handle them. For more information on Card Storage, see our [main article](/ecommerce/expand-your-integration/card-storage).

## Create a payer and store a card
To enable Card Storage, you need to add three fields to the HPP request. If you don't want to charge the card before storing it, you can process an Open-To-Buy (OTB) transaction. This request type checks that it is a valid and active card and that the customer provided the correct security code, address details and 3D Secure authentication.

## Display stored cards to the customer

This request type sends the customer reference to the HPP to display all of the customer’s stored cards for subsequent transactions. The security code is captured on the HPP and included in the authorization.

The reference is returned in the response field `SAVED_PAYER_REF`. You can then add it to the request when the customer returns to checkout.

## Credential on File
To override the default Credential on File (COF) behavior of the HPP, you will need to pass the Type, Initiator, and Sequence fields. The SRD field is optional.

COF can be used in Authorization and Validation (Open-to-Buy/OTB) with Card Storage.

For a full description of COF fields and use cases, see our [Credential on File](/ecommerce/risk-management/3ds/COF) article.

The Type, Initiator and Sequence fields must be populated to be considered valid. If any of these fields are not populated, it will be considered invalid and an error will occur.

## Generate hash
Follow the steps in this section to build the request security hash, concatenate the specified fields and hash them using the SHA-1 algorithm, concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret, hash it again, and add the resulted string to the request.

<Infobox>
In addition to SHA-1, you can also generate your hash using SHA-256. The resulting hash should be placed in the `<sha256hash>` tag instead of the `<sha1hash>` tag. For more information, contact our support team.
</Infobox>

### Build the request hash
Use the tabs below to follow the steps for a certain request type: "Create a payer and store a card" or "Display stored cards to the customer" 

<Tabs active="create">  
<Tab id="create" title="Create a payer and store a card">

##### 1. Create a SHA-1 hash made up of request values
The blueprint of the hash for this request is:

<Code id="xml" title="" language="xml">
```
"timestamp.merchantid.orderid.amount.currency.payer.paymentmethod"
```
</Code>

Based on the POST example above our initial string will be:

<Code id="xml" title="" language="xml">
```
"20200205093140.MerchantId.N6qsk4kYRZihmPrTXWYS6g.1001.EUR.376a2598-412d-4805-9f47-c177d5605853.ca46344d-4292-47dc-9ced-e8a42ce66977"
```
</Code>

If you choose not to supply your own references, it will be:

<Code id="xml" title="" language="xml">
```
"20200205093140.MerchantId.N6qsk4kYRZihmPrTXWYS6g.1001.EUR.."
```
</Code>

##### 2. Concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret
After step 1 you'll have a string like: 28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882

You'll need to concatenate this with your Shared Secret, for example:

<Code id="xml" title="" language="xml">
```
"28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882.Po8lRRT67a"
```
</Code>

##### 3. SHA-1 hash the concatenated string
Our final string that we add to the request should be a hash, using the SHA-1 algorithm, of your concatenated string. For example: 947903969e7aaf996164c680a6669805fe405269

</Tab> 
  <Tab id="display" title="Display stored cards to the customer">

```
"28b85cd34d0e0d6b243d58f0e9f7f4bf7da1b882.Po8lRRT67a"
```
</Code>

##### 3. SHA-1 hash the concatenated string
Our final string that we add to the request should be a hash, using the SHA-1 algorithm, of your concatenated string. For example: 947903969e7aaf996164c680a6669805fe405269

</Tab> 
</Tabs>

## Check hash
Follow the steps in this section to build the response security hash, concatenate the specified fields and hash them using the SHA-1 algorithm, concatenate the hashed string with your Shared Secret, hash it again, and add the resulted string to the request.

### Check the Response hash
Use the tabs below to follow the steps for a certain request type: "Create a payer and store a card" or "Display stored cards to the customer"

<Infobox>
The Timestamp returned in the response will be identical to the one sent in the request POST. This, combined with the Order ID and other transaction variables, can be used to definitively link the response received with the transaction request and order created in your application. You should also check the other transaction variables, for example the Amount, against what was stored in your application at the time the request POST was sent.

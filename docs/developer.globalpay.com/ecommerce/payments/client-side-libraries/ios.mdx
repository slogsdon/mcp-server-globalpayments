pod 'RXPiOS', '~> 1.5.0'
```
</Code>
2) Next, run the following command: <br />
<Code id="XML" title="" language="XML" active>

2) Drag and drop the **RealexComponent** folder into Xcode to use the HPP part of the library.
3) Run the following command: <br />
<Code id="XML" title="" language="XML" active>

$ pod install
```
</Code>
4) If you want to use the card data validation library, drag and drop the **RealexRemote** folder into your Xcode project.

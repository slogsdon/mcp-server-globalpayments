**Sandbox:** https://api.sandbox.globalpay-ecommerce.com/installments/plans/match <br/>

## Step 3: Confirm selected plan
To confirm the selected installment plan by the user, send the plan details in the Authorization request. After the cardholder selects an installment plan, the merchant should provide installment plan details in Auth and Receipt-in requests under the optional XML tag.

For the full Authorization request, see the API Reference for [Card Payments](/ecommerce/api/card-payments#api-authorization).

In this guide, you'll learn how to integrate Installment Service with the Hosted Payment Page (HPP) and how to use it to offer installment payments to your customers.

## Step 1: Set up the service
To use our Installment Service, you first need to get it enabled on your account. To do this, contact your account manager.

Setting up the service for HPP integration typically works like this:

![Installment plan HPP flow between the customer, the merchant, the HPP, and Visa.](/gh-assets/ecommerce/installments_hpp-s1-setup.png)

## Step 2: Select and confirm plan
There are two ways to perform this step (card on file and guest checkout). Select the applicable step for your region.

**Canada**

* [Card on file (Canada)](#card-on-file-canada)
* [Guest checkout (Canada)](#guest-checkout-canada)

**UK**

* [Card on file (UK)](#card-on-file-uk)
* [Guest checkout (UK)](#guest-checkout-uk)

### Card on file (Canada)

In this scenario, a customer with an existing account pays with a saved card.

1. In the **Payment Details** section, expand **Pay with a saved card**, and select a card that is eligible for installments. 
    ++Note++: Look for the green “Eligible for Installments” label as shown below. <br/><br/>
    <img alt="Payment Details screen with the Eligible for Installments label in green."src="/gh-assets/ecommerce/installments_hpp-card-on-file.png" width="400" height="300" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto"}} /> <br/>
2. Choose an installment plan.
    ++Note++: The default card payment option is PAY IN FULL. If available, up to two installment plans will be displayed underneath the default. <br/><br/>
    <img alt="List of three installment plans: Pay In Full (selected), Pay In 6, and Pay In 12." src="/gh-assets/ecommerce/installments_hpp-list-of-plans.png" width="400" height="300" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto"}} /> <br/>
3. Review the T\&Cs of the selected installment plan. When finished, select the acknowledgement checkbox. <br/><br/>
    <img alt="Confirmation checkbox with smaller text explaining the plan's terms and conditions." src="/gh-assets/ecommerce/installments_hpp-terms.png" width="400" height="300" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto"}} /> <br/>
    The expanded details of the selected installment plan include the following:
      * Number of installments (for example, Pay In 6)
      * Frequency of payments (for example, per month)
      * Installment payment amount (for example, 108.00 CAD/month)
      * Total fees per installment plan. <br/>
      ++Note++: in the UK and Canada, the APR is required for display (for example, APR: 0%).
      * Total amount inclusive of fees (for example, 648.00 CAD)
      * Description of the T\&Cs
      * Hyperlinked URL (additional terms within T\&Cs)
      * Hyperlinked URL (additional terms within T&Cs)
    
4.  Click **Pay Now**. The payment is processed with the selected installment plan.

### Guest checkout (Canada)

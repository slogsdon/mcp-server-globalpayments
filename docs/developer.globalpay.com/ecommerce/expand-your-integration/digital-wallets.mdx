We offer merchants several ways to integrate digital wallets into their application or website to make the checkout experience secure, fast, and convenient. 

## What is it?
Digital wallets can store a customer’s payment and personal information on an app or browser for quick payments in-person, online, or on a mobile device. Customers pay securely with just a scan, tap, or click. 

The benefits of having digital wallets in your ecommerce store include:

* _A seamless customer experience with minimal friction_ – Digital wallets are easy to use and access from any device. And they make paying fast.
* _Enhanced security_ – Digital wallets use tokenization, which protects sensitive card data by replacing it with secure substitute data called a _token_.
* _Better authorization rates_ – Replacing sensitive card data reduces the risk associated with ecommerce transactions and can increase authorization rates as a result. 
* _Faster online checkouts_ – When customers pay with their digital wallets, they pay directly in a couple of clicks, with no need to re-enter their credit card information online.

For information on alternative or local digital wallets, see our [Supported Payment Methods](/docs/payments/payment-methods/supported-payment-methods) page and filter by _Digital Wallets_.

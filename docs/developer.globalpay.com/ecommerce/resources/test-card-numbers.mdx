When testing your integration, you should never use real card details or banking information. That’s why we provide simulated payment methods such as test card numbers, test banks (for Open Banking), and even test installment plans (for Visa Installment Service). Use these resources to test different scenarios for your application or website.

## Card type strings

<sup>†</sup> The expected ECI value associated with the corresponding transaction status. <br /> ++Note++: Values may vary depending on the card issuer; however, the ECI will always indicate if there is a liability shift in favor of the merchant or not and can be used as a guide on whether to proceed to authorization.

<sup>†††</sup> Transaction was attempted but not successful; however, the bank is still willing to offer chargeback protection, so the transaction proceeds. Success is expected in this scenario.

## Apple Pay
Based on the amount specified in the token, the Sandbox environment maps the tokenized data in the transaction to one of our test cards. Any card details can be used in the token — they won't be logged, stored, or used for transaction processing. The table below lists the amount to specify in your Apple Pay token to test Visa and Mastercard (MC) and result scenarios.

## Open Banking & Bank Payment

Our infrastructure partner, Token.io, provides a mock bank to use for testing Bank Payment. For steps on using this mock bank, see the Testing Bank Payment section of our [guide](/ecommerce/expand-your-integration/open-banking-guide).
  
| Payment Amount | Scenario | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| £101 | Transfer status = SUCCESS  <br/>Transitions through PROCESSING | Reproduces successful payment initiation. |
| £103 | Transfer status = FAILURE\_GENERIC  <br/>Transitions through PROCESSING | Reproduces FAILURE\_GENERIC transfer status. This status usually indicates a technical failure. Possibly, a failure callback was received from the bank, with no transaction status and no further information. |
| £104 | Transfer status = FAILURE\_PERMISSION\_DENIED  <br/>Transitions through PROCESSING | Reproduces FAILURE\_PERMISSION\_DENIED transfer status. This status indicates that the user was denied authorization at the bank. This status is only relevant for two-step payment flows. |
| £105 | Transfer status = PROCESSING | Reproduces transfer status PROCESSING. The transaction will not reach a final status, and it will automatically transition to INITIATED after 30 days. |
| £106 | Transfer status = FAILURE\_CANCELED  <br/>Transitions through PROCESSING | Reproduces FAILURE\_CANCELED transfer status. This status indicates that the payment initiation was canceled before execution. |
| £108 | Transfer status = FAILURE\_INSUFFICENT\_FUNDS  <br/>Transitions through PROCESSING | Reproduces FAILURE\_INSUFFICENT\_FUNDS transfer status. |
| £110 | Transfer status = INITIATED  <br/>Transitions through PROCESSING | Reproduces INITIATED transfer status. The transaction was initiated, but the result is unknown. This is the final status and will not get updated later. |
| £112 | Transfer status = FAILURE\_DECLINED  <br/>Transitions through PROCESSING | Reproduces FAILURE\_DECLINED transfer status. This status indicates that the payment initiation was rejected by the bank. |
| £116 | Request status = REJECTED  <br/>_StatusReasonInformation_ = Insufficient funds in selected accounts to make requested payment. | Reproduces the scenario when no transfer is created, but the bank has rejected the payment due to insufficient funds. Error messages can vary from bank to bank; this is only an example. |
| £117 | Request status = REJECTED   <br/>StatusReasonInformation = PERMISSION\_DENIED:  <br/>Forbidden `{"error":"FORBIDDEN","error\_code":"TEST36",  <br/>"error\_description":"Customer profile does not permit this action."}` | Reproduces the scenario when no transfer is created and the bank rejects the payment initiation call because of permission denied. Error messages can vary from bank to bank; this is only an example. |
| £118 | Transfer status = FAILURE\_DECLINED  <br/>StatusReasonInformation = CUST Transitions  <br/>through PROCESSING | Reproduces the scenario when transfer status is FAILURE\_DECLINED and the decline reason populated in the _statusReasonInformation_ field is the ISO20022 decline reason CUST. Decline reasons can vary from bank to bank; this is only an example. |
| £119 | Transfer status = FAILURE\_DECLINED  <br/>StatusReasonInformation = The order was not executed.  <br/>Order leads to exceeding the agreed daily limit.  <br/>Transitions through PROCESSING | Reproduces the scenario when transfer status is FAILURE\_DECLINED and the decline reason populated in the _statusReasonInformation_ field contains a decline description pointing to daily limit exceeded. Decline reasons can vary from bank to bank; this is only an example. |

For Bank Payment, we provide "test banks" instead of test cards. Each test bank provides a different result, as shown in the table below.
| Test Bank | Currency | Result | Webhook | Notes |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Natwest | £ | Pending or  Decline | Yes | Declines if the transaction amount is above the balance. |
| Lloyds | £ | Pending Only | No | |
| Ozone Modelo | £ | Success and Pending | No | Each “debtor account” provides a different outcome. |
| Commerzbank | € | Success Only | No | Select “Germany” first to see this bank option. |
| Deutsche Bank | € | Payment Not Complete | No | Select “Germany” first to see this bank option. |

The following table provides the login information for each test bank.

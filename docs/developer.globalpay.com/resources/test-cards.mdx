When testing your integration, you should never use real card details or banking information. That’s why we provide simulated payment methods such as test card numbers, test banks (for Open Banking), and even test installment plans (for Visa Installment Service). Use these resources to test different scenarios for your application or website.

## Apple Pay
Based on the amount specified in the token, the Sandbox environment maps the tokenized data in the transaction to one of our test cards. Any card details can be used in the token — they won't be logged, stored, or used for transaction processing. The table below lists the amount to specify in your Apple Pay token to test Visa and Mastercard (MC) and result scenarios.

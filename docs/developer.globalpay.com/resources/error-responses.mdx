## HTTP status codes
The HTTP status codes indicates at a high level whether the API call was successful or not. For example, the
_200 OK_ code indicates the successful execution of the API call and that there were no errors. Any non-200 http status code indicates an error.

| HTTP Status Code | Message | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 200 | OK | This represents a successful API action. | 
| 400 | Bad Request | Error: The API request has an error in it. |
| 401 | Not Authenticated | Error: Can’t authenticate with those credentials. Need to get a new access token. | 
| 403 | Forbidden | Error: Don’t have permission to execute that API action. | 
| 404 | Resource Not Found| Error: the resource referenced in the request cannot be found. | 
| 405 | Method Not Allowed | Error: The HTTP request method is not supported for the requested resource. |
| 409 | Duplicate | Error: The API request was blocked as it is seen as a duplicate action that must not processed. |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Error: Something unexpected happened. | 
| 502 | Bad Gateway | Error: Something unexpected happened when communicating with another system. | 
| 504 | Timeout | Error: API did not get a response from another system in the expected timeframe. |

## Action response
With every successful action, the following data is returned as part of the response.
  
| Property	| Description |
| ------- | -------- |
| id | Unique ID for that action. For example: ACT_udnMIdFzIcLC0kt6GatzZLsmyhvBXj |
| type | The type of action execute. For example: AUTHORIZE, REFUND, REVERESE |
| time_created	| The time the action executed in ISO8601. For example: 2025-03-20T13:44:14.327Z |
| result_code |	The result of the action from us. For example: SUCCESS or DECLINED |
| app_id | The unique ID of the app used to create the token associated with the executed action. For example: F45as8i3eaLHNfgsa12a4dEA2sddaA |

    "action": {
        "id": "ACT_noXZxzpagCCMyJT08Sz2tGkPji8WXN",

        "app_name": "my_sandbox_app"
    }
}
```
</Code>    

### Action result_code
The result of a successful API action is recorded in the `action.result_code` field as it always contains the API's result for the action. 

| action.result_code | Description | Examples | 
| ------- | ------- | ------- | 
| SUCCESS | indicates the action executed successfully.| When authorizing a card this means the card issuer authorized the transaction. |
| DECLINED | indicates the action DECLINED. This means to consider that payment is not allowed and goods or services should not be provided. | When authorizing a card this means the card issuer declined the transaction. |
| PENDING | indicates the result is not known but a final result will be subsequently provided. When the result is known result_code changes from PENDING to a SUCCESS, DECLINED or ERROR result_code.| This is result_code is currently only applicable for certain Asia Pacific payments methods when trying to void or reverse them. |
| ERROR | indicates the action was PENDING but when the final result was known, it had erred. | This is result_code is currently only applicable for certain Asia Pacific payments methods when trying to void or reverse them.|



### Payment method result & message
When processing transactions using a payment method (for example, a card), there are other fields in the response from the card provider that an integrator can examine to get more information about the response.

| Area | Description | Examples | 
| ------- | ------- | ------- | 
| Payment Method Result & Message | Indicates the payment method provider's result and associated message. | If a card authorization declines, the payment_method result and message include more detail from the Issuer on why it was declined. For example, 51 - INSUFFICIENT FUNDS. This is generated by the issuing bank, who will provide decline codes in the response back to the authorization platform. |

## Successful responses - 200 OK

These are API actions that executed successfully and did not error. They will return an action object in the response message.

<Infobox>
A DECLINED card transaction still returns a 200 OK as the action did execute successfully end to end, but the cardholder’s issuing bank declined the transaction.
The _action.result_code_ must also be examined. For more information, see the [Action result_code](#action-result_code) section.
</Infobox>
  
## Error responses
	
If the HTTP Status Code is 4xx or 5xx, then an error has occurred. 
	
Error responses contain the following fields.
  
| Property	| Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| error_code |	Categorizes the error into a specific group. | 
| detailed_error_code |	Specific code used to uniquely identify the error. |
| detailed_error_description |	Detailed verbiage of the specific error. |
	
#### Sample error response
<Code id="JSON" title="JSON" language="JSON" active>

<Infobox type="danger">

The following tables outline the implemented HTTP Status Codes, `error_code`, `detailed_error_code`, and `detailed_error_description` that the API can return when an error is encountered.

| HTTP | HTTP Message | error_code | detailed_error_code | detailed_error_description | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| 504 | Timeout  | TIMEOUT_DOWNSTREAM  | 50008  |  | 0, Occurs if we do not receive a response from the backend system and we're not sure if the transaction was successful or not. In this case, the POS is responsible for deciding whether to issue a reversal for this transaction.<br /> Used in cases where the transaction is an authorizing transaction, e.g., CreditAuth, CreditSale. If the transaction is non-authorizing (e.g., CreditAccountVerify, CreditReversal) and we receive no response, then we sends back a System Error (+1) to the POS. | 
| 504 | Timeout  | TIMEOUT_DOWNSTREAM  | 50009  | 31, Occurs when we attempt a reversal for the POS, but the reversal fails. In this case, the POS is responsible for issuing the reversal.  |

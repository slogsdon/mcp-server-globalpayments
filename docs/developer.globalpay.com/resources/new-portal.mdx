Some exciting changes have been made to improve your experience in finding the right content and solutions for your integration.

## New homepage
The “new look” of our homepage better showcases our solutions and provides quick links to key documentation.

### Some highlights:
* A Show Me the Process button that takes you to our new Getting Started section
* Online and In-Store Payments sections with links to key articles and overviews
* Payment solutions grouped by level of integration difficulty: No Code (plugins), Low Code (SDKs and libraries), and High Code (direct API)
* Links to plugins, SDKs, Libraries, and our API References
* An Expand Your Integration section to give you ideas for adding to your integration, with links to our most popular ones

## Improved navigation
Our new horizontal menu groups our capabilities under Getting Started, Integration Options, Payments, Risk Management, Operations & Reporting, Partners, API References, and Resources. A link to our Support section will feature prominently in the top-right corner, near the Login | Register button.

You’ll also notice that we’ve provided more guidance at the bottom of our articles so that you’ll know what to read next.

## Focus on REST API integration
This new look brings a separation of our two API technologies. Our primary focus will be on our newer one: REST API, which uses JSON code samples. That means we've moved our XML API documentation to a separate area of the portal. This includes all articles as well as the API and HPP Reference sections that contain the XML API specifications, syntax tables, and security hash instructions. 

We’ll continue to support the XML API integration option, but we want to encourage new visitors to our developer portal to build with a REST API framework using JSON. Our current XML API developers will still be able to find everything they need to manage their current integrations. Existing XML API articles will continue to be updated as usual, and new documentation will be added as new features are developed. To get to this section, you just need to select Switch To: XML API Docs from the Viewing dropdown list.

## New Payments section
Our Payments menu features our core documentation and is grouped by Online, In-Store, Recurring Payments, Tokenization, Payment Methods, and Manage Payments.

## New Getting Started section
Our Getting Started article expands into a full section of the portal, complete with several articles to help you get to know our portal and start your payments journey with us. We’ve also added some “Intro to Payments” content for our users who want to learn or brush up on payment terminology and understand how a basic transaction flow works.

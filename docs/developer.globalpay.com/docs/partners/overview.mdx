Partner Solutions is a collection of tools that enables software providers to deliver payments as a service to their customers. Partners can embed all aspects of managing a merchant’s account into their software or application. As a partner, you can:
* Integrate payments seamlessly into your software or application
* Use API-driven customer boarding for payments
* Report details on all merchant actions across transactions and settlement

## Merchants and Partners
When interacting with the API, you can act as either a merchant or a partner. This section covers the differences.

* A **merchant** represents a customer of ours who can use our API. Merchants can use all the capabilities our API has to offer. 
* **Partners** manage _merchants_. Partners are set up for the management capability on our API via Merchant Management Account (MMA). A partner can only execute API actions on behalf of merchants based on the management accounts configured for them, the permissions on those accounts, and the merchants associated with those accounts.

The table below summarizes the differences between a merchant and a partner.
| User Profile | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| Merchant | A person or company that sells goods or services. On our API it's a single identifier within our system API, called a MER_ID. Multiple permissions and accounts can be connected to this single MER_ID. |
| Partner | Act on behalf of their merchants. A partner can be associated with one or multiple MER_IDs. Partners on our system and API are defined by a Partner Id, called a PAR_ID. We provide the partner credentials directly; they cannot be generated via API.<br/><br/>Multiple MER_IDs can exist under a PAR_ID.<br/><br/>Multiple accounts associated with managing merchants or managing partner funds can be connected to a single PAR_ID. |

## Accounts & Products
#### Accounts
Partners and merchants are set up for capabilities on our API via accounts, and they can only execute API actions based on the accounts configured for them. 

The following table describes each account type.
| Capability | Type | Account | Description |
| -------- | -------- | --------| -------- |
| Funds Management | Partner | FMA | Used to transfer funds between accounts with us, or to move funds from an account with us to a business bank account or debit card. |
| Merchant Management | Partner | MMA | Used to grant a partner the capabilities to board, manage, and transact on behalf of merchants. |
| Tokenization Management |	Merchant | TKA | Used to tokenize payment methods. For example, to store a card or use Hosted Fields. |
| Transaction Processing | Merchant | TRA | Used to create and manage transactions (i.e. authorize, capture, reverse, adjust) as well as activities that occur before or after transaction creation and management (e.g. 3D Secure and card validations). |

#### Products
Products represent the capabilities a partner can set up for a merchant using their MMA. For example, Transaction Processing, Funds Management, 3D Secure, and so on—and are a simple mechanism to create accounts for a merchant. One or more products can be referenced when creating a merchant so that the accounts needed by that merchant for the associated capability actions will be created.

The following table shows what accounts are created for a product.
| Product Name | Product ID | Account Created Name | Account Created Id |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |

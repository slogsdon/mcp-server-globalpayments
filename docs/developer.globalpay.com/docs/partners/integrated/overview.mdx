Integrated payments refer to the process of connecting a payment solution or service to a broader software platform or system, such as a point-of-sale (POS) system, e-commerce site, or a software application. The integration allows for data exchange between the payment system and the software, automating processes like payment acceptance, tracking, and reconciliation.
 
**Key characteristics:** Connection between systems, unified experience for users, variations of customizsation A single integration and single set of API keys allow a partner to facilitate payments, retrieve reporting, and manage disputes.
 
* Example 1: A restaurant POS system that integrates with a payment processor to accept credit card payments, sync transactions, and manage sales reports.
* Example 2: An e-commerce website that connects its shopping cart software to a payment gateway like Global Payments.

Using our Disputes API allows you to automate the reporting and management of transaction disputes. This includes the ability to challenge disputes.

In this guide for partners, you’ll first learn a little about what a dispute is. We then provide steps that show you how to get a dispute, receive a dispute notification via webhook, and challenge a dispute.

## What is a dispute?
A dispute (also known as a _chargeback_) occurs when a transaction’s validity is questioned and can be raised by the cardholder or the card issuer. In either scenario, the issuer sends the dispute to the acquirer to resolve. In some cases, the merchant needs to provide evidence that the transaction is legitimate.

When a merchant receives the dispute, they can challenge it by sending evidence to prove the transaction is legitimate. We review the evidence to ensure it meets the necessary requirements before sending it to the issuer. The issuer then reviews the evidence provided and makes a decision on the outcome of the dispute. 

## Get a dispute
As a partner, you have the ability to get a list of disputes raised against one of your merchants. The data only goes back 2 years, and the date range must be within 31 days. A 30-minute waiting time period is required for any report where the same date range and merchant applies.

Additional information
----------------------

This section contains information on payment solutions such as [Hosted Fields](#hosted-fields "Hosted Fields section") and [Hosted Payment Page](#hosted-payment-page "Hosted Payment Page section"), risk management solutions such as [3D Secure](#3d-secure "3D Secure section"), as well as enhanced features such as [Card Management](#card-management "Card Management") and [Order Management](#order-management "Order Management section").

For the Buy Now Pay Later payment methods (Affirm, Clearpay, and Klarna), additional information on checkout flow can be found in the [Async Payment Methods](#async-payment-methods "Async Payment Method section") section.

### Hosted Fields

For information on our PCI DSS requirement-reducing hosted solution, Hosted Fields (Drop-In UI), see our [Hosted Fields - Overview](/docs/payments/online/hosted-fields-overview "Hosted Fields Overview") page.

### Hosted Payment Page

For information on our Hosted Payment Page for Unified Payments REST API integrators, see our [Hosted Payment Page - Overview](/docs/payments/online/hosted-payment-page-overview "Hosted Payment Page Overview") page.

### 3D Secure

For information on our 3D Secure solutions, see our [3D Secure - Overview](/docs/3DS-overview "3D Secure Overview") page. We provide a Simulator Issuer Access Control Server that allows you to test different 3D Secure scenarios. For more information, see the [3D Secure section](/resources/test-cards#3dsecure-2 "Test Cards - 3D Secure") of our Test Cards article.

### Card Management

All card data is tokenized using our tokenization service.

Registered customers can save their card information by selecting the “Save to account” checkbox in the checkout form. The OpenCart plugin securely stores card data with us and receives a token representation of the card, which is stored in the OpenCart vault, with no increased PCI compliance requirements.

1.  The customer can choose from the list of their stored cards.
    
    ![Send payment method tab with Confirm Order button](/gh-assets/plugins/OpenCart1-5x-AsyncPM1.png)
    
2.  Registered customers can see the list of their stored cards under **My Account > Cards**. Here, they can delete the stored cards or add new ones.

#### Async Payment Methods

<Infobox>This section applies only to the Buy Now Pay Later payment methods (Affirm, Clearpay, and Klarna) and the Bank Payment payment method. All sections except “Receiving the final payment status” apply to PayPal as well.</Infobox>

Because these payment methods are handled by third-party services and require further processing from these third parties, the checkout flow has some differences compared with the Unified Payments or Digital Wallets ones.

#### Initiate the payment

1.  When a customer clicks the **Place Order** button, the order is placed with a “Waiting for payment” status.
2.  Once the order has been created, an Initial Payment request type will occur.

#### Redirect to third-party service

If the Initiate Payment request is successful, the customer will be redirected to the third-party service to pay.

![Affirm page with mobile number field and continue button](/gh-assets/plugins/OpenCart1-5x-AsyncPM2.png)
<p style={{textAlign: "center"}}>**Third-Party Service Example**</p>

#### Redirect back to your website

##### Cancel the payment

##### Successfully completing the payment

1.  If the customer successfully completes the payment, they will be redirected to the success page.
2.  At this point, the order will still have a **Pending Payment** status. For more details, see the next section.

#### Receiving the final payment status

1.  If the customer decides to cancel the payment using the option provided by the third party service (for example, clicking the X button on top left of the screen), they will be redirected to the cart page and the order that was previously created will be canceled.
    
    ![Affirm confirmation message to cancel loan request](/gh-assets/plugins/OpenCart1-5x-AsyncPM3.png)
    
2.  The order canceling will not be processed in your website if the customer decides to leave the page using another option (for example, browser back button, browser X button, or closing the tab); therefore, the order will still have the ‘Waiting for payment’ status in these cases.

If you are using Apache, you will need a version **greater than 2.4.47** and the following directive added to your config: **SetEnv proxy-sendcl 1**. Otherwise, the orders within your platform will not be updated as expected.

1.  Since these payment methods are asynchronous, the final transaction status might not be available immediately.
2.  Once our system gets the final status, it will notify your website.
3.  At that point, the order status will be changed to **Processing**.

##### ‘Waiting for payment’ orders

1.  In cases where the orders are stuck in a **Pending Payment** status, we provide a **Get Transaction Details** button.
2.  Clicking **Get Transaction Details** fetches all the information about the current transaction and displays it in a pop-up window.
3.  Based on the Transaction Status, you can manually cancel the order or just continue with the normal flow.

### Order Management

1.  Detailed information relating to the transaction outcome is available in the **Orders** section for OpenCart.
2.  If payment was successful, the order status will be set to **Processing**.

#### Create an invoice – capture a transaction

Merchants who use “Authorize only” at checkout will authorize the funds on the customer's card, but the transaction won't be placed in the settlement file until we capture it.

The amount of time the funds can remain ring-fenced on the customer's card may vary between different Issuers and Acquirers. Card brands like Visa and Mastercard have their own rules around how long transactions can wait to be captured.

1.  You can view the response returned by us in the **Unified Payments** tab.
2.  When viewing the order, scroll down to the bottom of the page. The details of the response from us will be displayed.
3.  If successfully authorized, the funds will now be ring-fenced on the customer's account. When you want to include the transaction in the next settlement file (also known as a _batch_) you can simply send a Capture (Settle) request. When the transaction is captured with the Acquirer, the funds are deducted from the customer's account and settled into the merchant's account.
4.  Once complete, the result of the Settle request will be displayed.

#### Refund a captured transaction

Once an order has been successfully settled with your Acquirer, you can rebate the customer for 0% to 115% of the original order value. To do this, you must create a Partial Refund in OpenCart. 

1.  Navigate to **Sales > Orders**, and select the order you want to rebate.
2.  Click **Refund**. If no amount entered, a full refund of the authorized amount will be requested.
3.  This will send the rebate request to us. You can change the amount to rebate by editing the input field. 
4.  Once complete, you will be returned to the Order page. A message will display indicating the outcome of the rebate request. A comment will be also added to the **Unified Payments** tab.

#### Reverse a transaction

You can cancel a transaction before it is sent for funding. The transaction will be fully reversed. If you already captured (settled) the transaction, see the [Refund a captured transaction](#refund-a-captured-transaction "Refund a Captured Transaction section") section. 

1.  Scenario 1: If the gateway has the payment action set to **Authorize only**:
    1.  In the Admin panel, select the order you want to reverse. It will have the status **Processing**.
    2.  Open the **Order History**, and select the **Unified Payments** tab.
2.  Scenario 2: If the gateway has the payment action set to **Authorize & Capture**:
    1.  In the Admin panel, select the order you want to reverse. It will have the status **Processing**.
    2.  Open the **Order History**, and select the **Unified Payments** tab.
3.  Next, click **Reverse**. _A warning message appears, asking if you want to proceed with the reverse._
4.  Click **OK**.
5.  Notice that a new entry line was added to the **Payment Information** list, indicating the voided (reversed) amount with the Payment Action “reverse.”
6.  Finally, go to **Add Order History** and manually change the Order Status from Processing to **Reversed**. Click **Add History**.

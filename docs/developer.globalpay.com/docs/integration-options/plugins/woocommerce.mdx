### Hosted Fields

For information on our PCI DSS requirement-reducing hosted solution, Hosted Fields (Drop-In UI), see our [Hosted Fields - Overview](/docs/payments/online/hosted-fields-overview "Hosted Fields Overview") page.

### Hosted Payment Page

For information on our Hosted Payment Page for Unified Payments REST API integrators, see our [Hosted Payment Page - Overview](/docs/payments/online/hosted-payment-page-overview "Hosted Payment Page Overview") page.

### 3D Secure

For information on our 3D Secure solutions, see our [3D Secure - Overview](/docs/3DS-overview "3D Secure Overview") page. We provide a Simulator Issuer Access Control Server that allows you to test different 3D Secure scenarios. For more information, see the [3D Secure section](/resources/test-cards#3dsecure-2 "Test Cards - 3D Secure") of our Test Cards article.

### Card Management

<Infobox>All card data is tokenized using our tokenization service.</Infobox>

Registered customers can save their card information by selecting the “Save to account” checkbox in the checkout form. The WooCommerce plugin securely stores card data with us and receives a token representation of the card, which is stored in the WooCommerce vault, with no increased PCI compliance requirements.

1.  The customer can choose from the list of their stored cards.
    
    ![Credit card selection list and Place Order button](/gh-assets/plugins/WooCommerce-Cardmgt1.png)
    
2.  Registered customers can see the list of their stored cards under **My Account > Payment Methods**.
    
    ![Payment methods list of stored cards](/gh-assets/plugins/WooCommerce-Cardmgt2.png)
    
3.  Registered customers can add new payment methods by navigating to **My Account > Payment Methods > Add Payment Method**. A validation of the payment method is done to ensure it can be used to create a transaction at a later time and the card data is received through Hosted Fields.
    
    ![Credit card details page and Add Payment Method button](/gh-assets/plugins/WooCommerce-Cardmgt3.png)
    

### Order Management

Detailed information relating to the transaction outcome is available in the Orders section for WooCommerce. 

#### Capture a transaction

Merchants who use “Authorize only” at checkout will authorize the funds on the customer's card, but the transaction won't be placed in the settlement file until We capture it. The amount of time the funds can remain ring-fenced on the customer's card may vary between different Issuers and Acquirers. Card brands like Visa and Mastercard have their own rules around how long transactions can wait to be captured. 

1.  You can view the Transaction ID returned by us under the order details.
    
    ![Edit order details screen](/gh-assets/plugins/WooCommerce-Ordermgt1.png)
    
2.  If successfully authorized, the funds will be ring-fenced on the customer's account. When you want to include the transaction in the next settlement file (also known as a _batch_), you can simply send a Capture (Settle) request. When the transaction is captured with the Acquirer, the funds are deducted from the customer's account and settled into the merchant's account.
3.  To capture a transaction, on the right-hand menu, go to **Order** **actions**. Select **Capture credit card authorization** to send the request to us.
    
    ![Choose an action drop-down list with Capture Credit Card Authorization selected](/gh-assets/plugins/WooCommerce-Ordermgt2.png)
    
4.  When finished, click **Update**. _A Capture request with the total amount authorized will now be sent._  
5.  Once complete, the result of the Settle request will be displayed as a comment in the Order notes. For example: Transaction captured. Transaction ID for the capture: TRN\_Q5LIgwyAGg19h6OSmTWPSHTtygss5c\_0426b98fcb98).
    
    ![two order notes with saved transaction information ](/gh-assets/plugins/WooCommerce-Ordermgt3.png)
    

#### Refund a captured transaction

Once an order is successfully settled with your Acquirer, you can rebate the customer for 0% to 115% of the original order value. To do this, you must do a Refund in WooCommerce. 

1.  Navigate to **WooCommerce > Orders**, and select the order you want to rebate. 
2.  You can edit the amount to rebate by editing the adjustment fields provided by WooCommerce.
    
    ![Refund input fields with buttons for refunding manually or via Unified Payments](/gh-assets/plugins/WooCommerce-Ordermgt4.png)
    
3.  Once complete, the result of the Refund request will be displayed as a comment in the Order notes. For example: €10.00 was reversed or refunded. Transaction ID: TRN\_USaGaxBIRCQajDlqcqPolBkUwfRAL4\_0426b98fcb98.

### Async Payment Methods

<Infobox>This section applies only to the Buy Now Pay Later payment methods (Affirm, Clearpay, and Klarna) and the Bank Payment payment method. All sections except “Receiving the final payment status” apply to PayPal as well.</Infobox>

Because these payment methods are handled by third-party services and require further processing from these third parties, the checkout flow has some differences compared with the Unified Payments or Digital Wallets ones.

#### Initiate the payment

1.  When a customer clicks the **Place Order** button, the order is placed with a “Waiting for payment” status.
2.  Once the order has been created, an Initial Payment request type will occur.

#### Redirect to third-party service

If the Initiate Payment request is successful, the customer will be redirected to the third-party service to pay.

![Affirm login screen with enter mobile number field and Continue button](/gh-assets/plugins/PrestaShop-Async-PM2.png)
<p style={{textAlign: "center"}}>**Third-Party Service Example**</p>

#### Redirect back to your website

##### Cancel the payment

1.  If the customer decides to cancel the payment using the option provided by the third-party service (for example, clicking the X button on top left of the screen), they will be redirected to the cart page and the order that was previously created will be canceled.
    
    ![Popup message to confirm cancelation without completing loan request](/gh-assets/plugins/PrestaShop-Async-PM3.png)
    
2.  The order canceling will not be processed in your website if the customer decides to leave the page using another option (for example, browser back button, browser X button, or closing the tab); therefore, the order will still have the “Waiting for payment” status in these cases.

##### Successfully completing the payment

1.  If the customer successfully completes the payment, they will be redirected to the success page.
2.  At this point, the order will still have a **Pending Payment** status. For more details, see the next section.

#### Receiving the final payment status

<Infobox>If you are using Apache, you will need a version **greater than 2.4.47** and the following directive added to your config: **SetEnv proxy-sendcl 1**. Otherwise, the orders within your platform will not be updated as expected.</Infobox>

1.  Because these payment methods are asynchronous, the final transaction status might not be available immediately.
2.  Once our system gets the final status, it will notify your website.
3.  At that point, the order status will be changed to **Processing**.

#### ‘Waiting for payment’ orders

1.  In cases where the orders are stuck in a **Pending Payment** status, we provide a **View Transaction Info** button.
    
    ![Transaction status page with View Transaction Info button](/gh-assets/plugins/WooCommerce-AsycPM5.png)
    
2.  Clicking **View Transaction Info** fetches all the information about the current transaction and displays it in a pop-up window.
3.  Based on the Transaction Status, you can manually cancel the order or just continue with the normal flow.

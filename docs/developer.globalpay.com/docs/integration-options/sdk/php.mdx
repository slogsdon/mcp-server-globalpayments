## Requirements
For security and support, we highly recommend you use PHP 8+.
* PHP >= 8.0.0

## Installation
Installing the SDK into your solution is usually done using [Composer/Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/globalpayments/php-sdk).

### Composer
Add the following to your composer.json file:

<Code>
```
{
    "require": {
        "globalpayments/php-sdk": "2.0.0"
    }
}
```  
</Code>

<br />
Inside the application directory, run composer (from the command line):
<Code>
```
composer update OR (depending on your server configuration) php composer.phar update
```
</Code>

<br />
Add a reference to the autoloader class anywhere you need to use the SDK:

<Code>
```
require_once ('vendor/autoload.php');
```
</Code>

## GitHub
Download the the latest release of the SDK from [GitHub](https://github.com/globalpayments/php-sdk).

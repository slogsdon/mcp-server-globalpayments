## Drop-In UI and Hosted Fields
Our JavaScript Library allows you to integrate the Drop-In UI payment form into your web application easily. Alternatively, you can use the Hosted Fields components on their own with your existing checkout. To learn how to integrate this solution fully into your application, see our [Hosted Fields](/docs/payments/online/hosted-fields-overview) or [Drop-In UI](/docs/payments/online/drop-in-ui-overview) documentation.

## Using our Javascript Library
<Code id="Javascript" language="xml">
```
<script src="https://js.globalpay.com/4.1.3/globalpayments.js"></script>
```
</Code>

<br />
You can explore the JavaScript Library on [GitHub](https://github.com/globalpayments/globalpayments-js).

## 3D Secure 2 Library
The JavaScript Library leverages our 3D Secure solution and helps handle the notification to and from the Issuer Access Control Server (ACS), as well as help with the front end for displaying the challenge to the customer. To learn how to integrate 3D Secure, see our [Browser Authentication for 3D Secure](/docs/risk-management/3D-secure/browser-authentication-guide) article.

### npm
<Code id="Javascript" language="xml">
```
npm i globalpayments-3ds
```
</Code>

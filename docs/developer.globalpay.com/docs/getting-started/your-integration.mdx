To start building your integration, you first need to choose an integration path. Then see what documentation and other resources we provide to help you build and test your integration for free.

## Choose your integration path
Using a <Tooltip content="Stands for Representational State Transfer. A type of API architecture that uses HTTP requests.">REST</Tooltip> framework, our API provides a single integration to connect into numerous regions, channels, and payment methods worldwide. We have solutions for every level of expertise: 
* **No code** – Download one of our compatible plugins like WooCommerce or Adobe Commerce (formerly Magento) to add an “out of the box” payment page to your website.
* **Low code** – Use an SDK or a client-side library to simplify your integration and get to market faster. 
* **High code** – Send direct API requests for a highly customized integration that you control completely.

To access our Sandbox, you first need to get registered on this developer portal and create an app. To execute any API requests, you also need to create an access token.

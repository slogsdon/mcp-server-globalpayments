Welcome to our developer portal! We’re happy you’re here.

This area of our portal tells you everything you need to know about our integration process — from setting up a free account so you can simulate taking payments or try different features to signing up with us to take payments for real.

## First steps
#### New to payments?

If you’re new to the payments industry, you first may want to learn the basics, such as how a card transaction works and how the key players interact with each other. We also define the common terms that are used on our portal.

#### Prerequisites
There are a few things you need to do before getting started. For instance, to access our testing Sandbox, you first need to get registered on this developer portal and create an app to generate test credentials.

   Registering with us means you can create multiple test apps to manage different projects and use them for testing or trying out new features.

Next, to execute any API requests, you need to create an access token.

## Get to know our portal
As you navigate around our site, you’ll get a high-level overview of what our API can do, what solutions we offer, and what free resources are available to help you on your journey to integrate with us.

We recommend that you register before you start exploring so that you can save the pages you find useful and want to refer back to. After logging in, you’ll see a Save button in the top-right corner of every page. Use it to bookmark your favorite pages as you get to know our portal. You can then access and manage your saved pages on your account page.

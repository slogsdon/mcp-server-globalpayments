We offer an easily implemented Recurring Payments solution. Our platform is equipped to handle credential-on-file transactions that are compliant with modern standards to enable seamless integration.

## Use cases
In this section, we present some “real world” examples that can be enabled through Recurring Payments. Keep in mind that this section doesn’t cover all use cases.

##### Use case #1: One-click checkout
An online retailer wants to allow customers to save card information for later purchases. When a customer returns to their website to purchase more items, they can use the saved card details to check out faster. A correctly integrated shopping cart software then sends the details to our API for running the subsequent transaction.

##### Use case #2: Subscriptions
A meal delivery service wants to implement subscription plans to ensure customers are able to easily register and pay for their meals. While the service’s systems manage subscriptions, customers, and triggering the payments, our Recurring Payments solution is ready to accept the initial transaction, create a payment token, and wait for any recurring payments to be sent.

##### Use case #3: Account top-up
A restaurant using ecommerce software to manage their gift cards wants to allow their customers to refill their card under a certain threshold. Using our Recurring Payments solution, the owner can send a transaction request from their software to our servers authorizing and capturing the payments as they occur.

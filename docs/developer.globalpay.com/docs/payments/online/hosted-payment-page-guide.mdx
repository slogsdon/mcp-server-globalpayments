  The Hosted Payment Page (HPP) is currently not available in the Asia Pacific region. For more information, check with your account manager.
</Infobox>

This guide focuses on adding the HPP to your application or website. After creating an access token, we set up the request to create a unique payment link. Using the HPP URL returned in the response, we then redirect the customer to facilitate authentication and authorization. After receiving the response and checking the transaction outcome, we then handle the redirect to your application’s appropriate successful or failed page.

For an overview of the HPP, see our [Overview](/docs/payments/online/hosted-payment-page-overview) page.

To learn how to enable more value-added services to the HPP, see the [Enhance your integration](#enhance-your-integration) section.

## Prerequisites
Before starting the steps in this guide, you must do the following:

* [Get registered](/docs/getting-started/register)
* [Create an app (generate keys)](/docs/getting-started/register#create-an-app-generate-keys)
* [Create an access token](/docs/getting-started/generate-token)

## Step 1: Create the HPP URL
First, we create a unique payment link using the Create Link request. This request also retrieves some necessary information to facilitate the redirect and authentication of the customer. 

Our sample request performs a standard card payment with 3D Secure and uses only mandatory and recommended fields (for the full list of HPP Link fields, see the [table](#hpp-link-field-definitions)). It also includes information on API methods and request data.

   }
}
  ```
</Code>
</CodeGroup>


## Step 2: Redirect the customer
Once the link is created, the customer must be redirected using the URL returned in the Create Pay by Link response to facilitate authentication and authorization. You can use a simple JavaScript redirect or HTTP GET (302 redirect).

For information on API methods and request/response data, see [Links](/api/links) in the API Explorer.

In this example, you redirect the customer to the URL using JavaScript.

### Sample redirect

<CodeGroup>
<Code id="HTML" language="xml" title="HTML" active contextualLinks={{apiExplorerUrl: "/api/links"}}>
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <title>Sample Redirect</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>

<body>
  <script>
    window.location = "https://apis.sandbox.globalpay.com/ucp/hpp/redirect/42060877-8bf9-4ae3-a3ae-99a6da10cf41";
  </script>
</body>

</html>
```
</Code>
</CodeGroup>

<br/>
<br/>
Once redirected to the URL, your customer will be presented with the HPP.

![Example of the HPP on a desktop computer screen](/gh-assets/hpp_desktop.png)
 <p style={{textAlign: "center"}}>**HPP Desktop Example**</p>

## Step 3: Check transaction outcome, handle redirect

Once the customer completes the transaction, a transaction response is sent to your Return URL to inform your system of the transaction result. The response contains the outcome of the transaction, whether it was a success or a decline. It also contains the Transaction ID (`TRN_ID`), which can be used to manage the transaction — such as performing a reversal or reporting on the transaction.

When the transaction is complete, the HPP will render the contents of the URL supplied in the `return_url`. The URL should only contain basic HTML and JavaScript. The URL should redirect the customer to the final transaction complete page on your website or application.

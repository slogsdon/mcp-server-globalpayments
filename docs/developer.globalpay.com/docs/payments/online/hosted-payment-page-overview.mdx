The Hosted Payment Page (HPP) is our <Tooltip content="Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard">PCI DSS</Tooltip>–compliant hosted solution, allowing merchants to capture addresses for customer billing and shipping, contact information, and card details all through one simple redirect or embedded integration.

Using the HPP along with our SDKs and libraries means that you can set up a secure payment form in your application or website in minutes. The library handles the opening, display, and response of the HPP on a desktop, tablet, mobile device (both iOS and Android apps), or in-app, with minimal configuration required.

For merchants, the benefits of the HPP include:
* Prebuilt forms for your payment pages
* Simplest level of PCI DSS compliance: <Tooltip content="Self-Assessment Questionnaire A is for merchants who outsource card data responsibility to a third party.">SAQ A</Tooltip>
* Secure address forms to collect other customer details
* Built-in input validation of payment fields
* Seamless integration with desktop, tablet, mobile, or in-app
* Cross-channel secure payment acceptance and customer identification

Here's an example of the standard HPP Payment Details form added to a fictitious merchant’s payment page.

## Use cases
In this section, we present some “real world” examples that can be enabled through our HPP solution. Keep in mind that this section doesn’t cover all of the use cases.

##### Use case #1: Secure
An online bakery has just launched and wants to ensure that they are processing their transactions in a secure environment that is also PCI DSS compliant. Integrating with HPP means that sensitive card information is captured directly by us instead of their own website.

##### Use case #2: Convenient
A personal trainer has just gone live with their online training program. They’re working with a small team currently, so they can’t commit to any integration that requires too much maintenance. The HPP allows them to quickly set up with just a single request before they can start processing transactions.

##### Use case #3: Flexible
An online bike shop wants to allow their customers to pay using various payment methods. Integrating with the HPP will allow this merchant to accept card payments, digital wallets, alternative payment methods (APMs), and more.

## How does it work?
If you're using our other solutions through the HPP — like 3D Secure, APMs, or Fraud Management — the information gathered through the HPP will be used to populate the associated required fields. In other words, you don’t have to provide that additional information in the HPP request.

At a high level, HPP works like this:

#### 3D Secure
The HPP handles the entire 3D Secure authentication flow, including determining which version of 3D Secure to use, gathering the necessary device information, and presenting the challenge to the customer if required. The HPP then processes the authorization and passes the additional authentication information to the card issuer.

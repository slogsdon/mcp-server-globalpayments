For card-present transactions, using a standalone terminal purchased from us or one of our sales partners is the easiest in-store solution we offer and will get you up and running quickly. It comes with our Unified Payment Application (UPA) installed so that you can directly connect to our API, saving you the trouble of any code development. In fact, there aren’t any code samples for us to share here because no coding is needed.

To compare standalone with our other types of integration like cloud, semi-, and full, see [In-Store Payments - Overview](/docs/payments/in-store/overview).

## What is a standalone terminal?
_Standalone_ refers to an in-store terminal that integrates directly to our API but has no communication with your POS system. After purchasing one of our compatible terminals, either through us or from a partner, you’ll immediately be able to start running credit card transactions with little additional training. And there are no special platform/gateway certifications needed as the payment card data resides only within our already-certified compatible terminal. 

You’ll have everything you need to take payments, but you won’t be able to connect your POS system, customize the payment flow, or add any new functionality. If you want more flexibility to customize your terminal and don’t mind some coding, our API also supports [semi-integration](/docs/payments/in-store/semi-integration) and [full integration](/docs/payments/in-store/full-integration).

## What is UPA?
UPA is our proprietary payment application for standalone terminals. It can be loaded on a variety of compatible terminals (see next section) for direct access to our API. At present, only UPA terminals are capable of attaching to our API service, bringing the power and features of the Unified Payments API to your business.

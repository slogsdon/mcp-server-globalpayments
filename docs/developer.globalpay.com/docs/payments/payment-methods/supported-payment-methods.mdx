In addition to cards, we also offer integration with alternative and local payment methods so that you can accept transactions worldwide. You can integrate using one of our Hosted Solutions — such as the Hosted Payment Page (HPP) — or via direct API integration. We provide code samples to get you started. For direct API integrations, just pass the correct payment method string in the payment request.

To learn more about integrating with a specific non-card payment method, select it below. You can filter by payment category and country to pinpoint one that fits your needs.

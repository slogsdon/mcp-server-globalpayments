        We are delighted to announce the relaunch of our Developer Portal.
      
      This redesign includes a new look homepage promoting:
      * Payments and Value adds whether, [Online](/docs/payments/online/overview) or [In-Store](/docs/payments/in-store/overview)
      * Integration options for all levels of merchant, enterprise or partner with [No-Code Plugins](/docs/integration-options/plugins), [Low-Code SDKs](/docs/integration-options/sdk/overview) and [High-Code API](/docs/integration-options/api) integrations
      * We have made navigation much more intuitive and are now leading with our REST API offering while also providing a switch to our XML documentation. See how to [switch between REST and XML here](/resources/new-portal#focus-on-rest-api-integration)
      * NEW Get Started section to talk through how our portal works and where to begin integrating with us. We are also catering for customers new to the payments industry in this section.

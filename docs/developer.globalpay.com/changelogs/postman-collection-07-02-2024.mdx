        <ReleaseNoteDetail type="changed">
            Our new Postman collection enhances the developer's experience when integrating into our API and decreases the merchant's time to market.

            What's changed:

            - Customer-led restructured collection
            - Pre-populated environment variables to allow you to generate requests and view responses the moment you download the collection
            - Multiple integration use cases by API product and feature to support your integration

            To download the collection, see our [Postman Collection](/docs/postman-overview "Postman Collection") article.

<ReleaseNoteSection title="Headers">
    <ReleaseNoteDetail type="changed">
        * Added ability to send decompressed responses. Previously, all responses were encoded in `gzip` format. With this change, you can specify whether you want responses to use `gzip` formatting or `identity` formatting.
            * The header parameter `accept-encoding` lets you determine compression options.
            * To enable, set `accept-encoding` to `identity` on a request-by-request basis.
            * `gzip` will remain the default option for response encoding if no value is sent within the header.

## Encoding
The API assumes UTF-8 encoding in API requests and always returns UTF-8 encoding in all responses.

## Date and time
The API accepts and generates dates and times in the [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#General_principles) format and set to UTC. Date and times created and submitted by users must be in ISO-8601 but can be in the user's own timezone.

## Amounts
Amounts are always represented in the smallest common currency unit. There are no decimal points in amount values.

Here are some examples of currencies with different exponents and how the amount is represented in the API.
| Currency / Exponent | Example |
| --- | --- |
| US Dollar - 2 exponent currency	| $100.99 --> 10099 |
| Euro - 2 exponent currency | €34.59 --> 3459 |
| Japanese Yen - 0 exponent currency	| ¥145 --> 145 |
| Tunisian Dinar - 3 exponent currency	| DT 53.454 --> 53454| 
## Currencies
Currencies are always represented by the [ISO 4217 alpha code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes).

For example:
| Currency | ISO 4217 Code |
| --- | --- |
| US Dollar	| USD |
| Pound Sterling	| GBP |
| Canadian Dollar	| CAD |
| Singapore Dollar |	SGD |
| Euro	| EUR |
| Japanese Yen	| JPY |
| Tunisian Dinar	| TND |
## Countries
Countries are represented by the [ISO-3166-1(alpha-2 code)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Decoding_table).

For example:
| Country | ISO 3166-1 (Alpha-2 code) |
| --- | --- |
| United States of America | US |
| Singapore | SG |
| Canada | CA |
| Great Britain | GB |
| Australia | AU |
| Japan | JP |
| Hong Kong | HK |
## Languages
Languages are represented by the format [ISO-639-1(alpha-2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) alone or a combined  [ISO-639-1(alpha-2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) and [ISO-3166-1(alpha-2 code)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Decoding_table) by a hyphen delimiter.

For example:
| Language | ISO-639-1_ISO 3166-1 |
| --- | --- |
| English | en | 
| French | fr | 
| French Canadian | fr_CA | 
| Spanish | es | 
| Mexican Spanish | es_MX |

This guide outlines the different query string parameters and values that can be passed in the request to retrieve a list of resources. These concepts apply to all lists of resources, regardless of whether it is a list of transactions, disputes, or deposits. 

You can append query string parameters and values to the end of a resource endpoint to represent [search criteria](#search-criteria), fields to return, and [pagination](#pagination) information when retrieving lists of resources.

## Search criteria
Search criteria are query string parameters and values that indicate the resources to return in a list response. The following search criteria is used to return a list of disputes that are waiting on a response from the merchant (`status=WITH_MERCHANT`).

#### Sample request

<Code id="JSON" title="JSON" language="JSON" active>
```json
curl -v -X GET https://apis.globalpay.com/ucp/disputes?status=WITH_MERCHANT 
    -H "Content-type: application/json" 
    -H "X-GP-Version: 2021-03-22" 
    -H "Authorization: Bearer KnxbvhyY4GgBYq6mV64uEGLzotrw"
```
</Code>

## Pagination

Data can be returned more efficiently by using the pagination query parameters to retrieve pages of records for a large data set.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| order_by | Indicates the resource field to order the list by. The default is DATE_CREATED. | 
| order | Sets the ordering direction and can be ASC or DESC. The default is DESC. | 
| page_size | The number of records in the list to return in a single list response. The default is 5 and the max is 1000. | 
| page | Indicates what portion (page) of the full result list to return with this particular request. For example, a page of 1 and page_size of 10 will return records 1 to 10 of the entire result set, and a page of 2 and page_size of 10 will return records 11 to 20 of the entire result set, and so on. | 

<br />
The below example modifies the previous one so that only records 10-14 are returned and that the data set is ordered by the date the merchant needs to respond by, with the most recent first.

#### Sample request

<Code id="JSON" title="JSON" language="JSON" active>
```json
curl -v -X GET https://apis.globalpay.com/ucp/disputes?status=WITH_MERCHANT
&order_by=time_to_respond_by&order=DESC&page_size=5&page=3 
     -H "Content-type: application/json" 
     -H "X-GP-Version: 2022-12-31" 
     -H "Authorization: Bearer KnxbvhyY4GgBYq6mV64uEGLzotrw"
```
</Code>

## List response
The response to a list of resources can contain:

* The count of the total number of resources across the entire list, not just that page
* The count of resources returned in the current page
* The list of resources for the current page

The `total_count` value is returned on the first page and only if the search date range is within one month.

To determine the total number of pages to retrieve to get the entire result list, you can use the `total_count` on page 1 response if it's returned.

Alternatively, you can use the `current_page_size` from the response. When the `current_page_size` is less than the `page_size` then that is the last page to be retrieved.

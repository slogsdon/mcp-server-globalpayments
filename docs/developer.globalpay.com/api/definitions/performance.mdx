This guide focuses on ways to enhance the operation of our API. The tips provided here help reduce network bandwidth and ensure the predictability of API messages over a distributed network.

## Message encoding

Accept-encoding allows you to specify the content encoding methods your software can handle. We currently support `gzip` and `identity`.

| Header Name | Header Value |
| --- | --- |
| Accept-Encoding | gzip / identity |

Bandwidth usage is reduced across networks as response messages are compressed. *Content-Encoding: gzip* is used for all API responses.
| Header Name | Header Value |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Encoding | gzip |

## Pagination
Retrieve data efficiently by using the pagination query parameters to retrieve pages of records for a large data set (for more information, see [Lists](/api/definitions/lists).
| Query Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| page_size	| The total number of objects to return in a single page for that list. |
| page | Indicates the page sequence to return in the response. The number of records presented on each page is determined by `page_size` field. |

### Sample request

<Code id="JSON" title="JSON" language="JSON" active>
```json
curl -v -X POST https://apis.globalpay.com/ucp/disputes?status=WITH_MERCHANT
&order_by=time_to_respond_by&order-DESC&page_size=5&page=3 
    -H "Content-type: application/json" 
    -H "X-GP-Version: 2021-03-22" 
    -H "Authorization: Bearer KnxbvhyY4GgBYq6mV64uEGLzotrw" 
```
</Code>
## Idempotency
Use `X-GP-Idempotency` in the message header to ensure an action is not executed more than once. This is a user-generated value that can be up to 50 characters in length. If the same value is used again within 24 hours (for the same merchant), a response is returned indicating that the action was previously executed.

The scope of the key is applied at a Merchant ID level, regardless of the account or app being used to execute the action. In addition, it applies only to POST, PATCH, and DELETE operations; it does not apply to GET.

<Code id="JSON" title="JSON" language="JSON" active>
```json
curl -v -X POST https://apis.globalpay.com/ucp/deposits 
    -H "X-GP-Idempotency: 234quigdua7stduabkjwe"
    -H "X-GP-Version: 2021-03-22" 
    -H "Accept: application/json"
    -H "Content-type: application/json" 
    -H "Authorization: Bearer KnxbvhyY4GgBYq6mV64uEGLzotrw"
```
</Code>

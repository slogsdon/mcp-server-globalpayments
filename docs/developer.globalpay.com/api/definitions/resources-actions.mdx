The API is structured around resources and their associated actions. Resources are created, edited, and reported on by executing actions using the API. For example, a _/transactions_ resource is created by authorizing a card for a specific amount. It is edited by subsequently reversing it. 

This table outlines some example resources and their associated actions.

| Example Resource | Definition | Associated Action(s) | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| [/transactions](/api/transactions) | The transfer or attempt to transfer funds between a merchant and a payer using a payment method. | Authorize, Capture, Adjust, Reverse, Refund, Report |
| [/disputes](/api/disputes) | Questions or objections from a payer relating to a previous transaction.| Challenge, Accept, Reporting | 
| [/deposits](/api/deposits) | The debiting or crediting of funds to a merchant's bank account. | Reporting | 

### Resource IDs
For every instance of a resource, we create an ID that uniquely identifies that instance. These IDs are important as they are used to reference an instance of a resource when actioning in.

IDs are structured using the first three characters to represent the type of resource the instance refers to, followed by an underscore and then a unique string. For example, _TRN_C0kt6GatzZLsC0kt6GatzZLsmyhvBX_ is an unique ID for a transaction. 

IDs are created when the instance of the resource is created.

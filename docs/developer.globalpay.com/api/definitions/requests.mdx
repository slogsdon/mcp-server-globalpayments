This guide focuses on the key principles of executing API requests. 

## Environments
The environment you target, whether it's Sandbox or Production, is determined by the URL the request is sent to.

#### Sandbox
This is a test environment used to assess and test an integration to the API. Funds are never moved in this environment.

<Code id="JSON" title="" language="JSON" active>
```
https://apis.sandbox.globalpay.com/ucp
```
</Code>

#### Production
This environment is used to move actual funds between payers and merchants. 

<Code id="JSON" title="" language="JSON" active>
```
https://apis.globalpay.com/ucp
```
</Code>

## Resource location
The location to send requests to create, edit, or read resources is the base URL of the environment appended with the plural of the resource name.

For example: <br />

The **Transactions** URL is used to authorize, reverse, refund, capture, and report on transactions.

<Code id="JSON" title="" language="JSON" active>
```
https://apis.sandbox.globalpay.com/ucp/transactions 
```
</Code>
<br/>The **Disputes** URL is used to report on, challenge, and accept disputes.
<Code id="JSON" title="" language="JSON" active>
```
https://apis.sandbox.globalpay.com/ucp/disputes
```
</Code>
<br/>The **Deposits** URL is used to report on and reconcile deposits.
<Code id="JSON" title="" language="JSON" active>
```
https://apis.sandbox.globalpay.com/ucp/deposits
```
</Code>

## HTTP verbs
When initiating an action through the API, an HTTP verb needs to be used. The usage of this aspect of the HTTP protocol ensures a lightweight and intuitive experience. The verbs indicate the behavior of the action being executed.

* **GET** – Requests data about a single resource or a list of resources and is idempotent.
* **POST** – Creates or updates a resource and is not idempotent.
* **PATCH** – Partially updates an existing resource and is not idempotent.

## Headers
The following table outlines the properties that can be sent in the header of a request.

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Accept | Indicates the format of the response requested. Set to _application/json_. | 
| Authorization | Contains the access token to use in a request. | 
| Content-type | Indicates the format of the data in the request. Set to _application/json_. | 
| Accept-encoding | Confirms that compressed response messages can be received, reducing network bandwidth. Supports `gzip` and `identity`. | 
| X-GP-Version | Mandatory field that contains the version of the API to execute the request. | 
| Idempotency-key | Contains a unique user-generated value that if repeated in a subsequent request, within a 24-hour window, the subsequent request will fail. | 

## Sample request

<Code id="JSON" title="JSON" language="JSON" active>
```json
curl -v -X POST https://apis.globalpay.com/ucp/settlement/deposits 
    -H "X-GP-Version: 2021-03-22" 
    -H "X-GP-Idempotency: 234quigdua7stduabkjwe"
    -H "Content-type: application/json" 
    -H "Authorization: Bearer KnxbvhyY4GgBYq6mV64uEGLzotrw"
```
</Code>
